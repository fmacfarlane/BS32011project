                Hi, I'm Fiona Macfarlane and this is my webpage. I am currently undertaking the bioinformatics practical module. This webpage will display my dataset and allow the user to run specific queries. THe datset that was chosen to be represented, was a series of experiments ran to study the genetics of Glioblastoma Brain Tumours in humans. The following query box will allow the user to view the id reference of an experiment when submitting the gene identification code.
        <form method=POST action=cgi-bin/getquery.py>
	<table><tr>
                <td>select id_ref from probe where gene_id=</td>
                <td><input type=text name=query></td>
                <td><input type="submit" value="submit"></td>
        </tr></table>

	</form>
	</body>
