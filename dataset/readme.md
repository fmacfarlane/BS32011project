#This is my dataset directory

This directory holds the text files containing the information for the 4 sql tables, used to represent and manage the GDS Dataset. This directory also contains the scripts used to create, fill and assign the primary keys for the tables along with the python script used to seperate the data into the 4 text files.The commit comments describe the purpose of each of the files, apart from the mysql.txt file. The mysql.txt file was used to dump the tables into my mysql dataset on the virtual machine.
