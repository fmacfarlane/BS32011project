# My Bioinformatics Project

This file will describe my actions throughout the project.
Week2 =  I created this repository for my project. Then found a dataset on GEO to use. My dataset is from a study of brain tumours in humans, with 27 samples. I then created an SQL database table to store my data. I also created a subdirectory to store my dataand create file statements that I used. I then ensured all of my work was appropriately uploaded to github.
