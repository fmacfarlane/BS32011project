# My Bioinformatics Project

This file will describe my actions throughout the project.

#Week 2 
  I created this repository for my project. Then found a dataset on GEO to use. My dataset is from a study of brain tumours in humans, with 27 samples. I then created an SQL database table to store my data. I also created a subdirectory to store my dataand create file statements that I used. I then ensured all of my work was appropriately uploaded to github.
#Week 3
 I created the 4 tables and inserted the correct data into them. I also created primary keys within the tables. I added comments to the readdata.py script that was used to create text files witht he information needed to fill the tables.
#Week 4
 i created the classes file, and tested various queries on the data.
#Week 5
 I edited the classes script, added more queries, some included joining the tables. I created a text script for creating a webpag to display my data.
